# Sockets ðŸ”Œ
> A repository that stores various C excercises on network sockets

This repository contains various exercises and examples on network socket programming in C that I'm currently studyng for the "Networking" course of ["Sicurezza dei Sistemi e delle Reti Informatiche"](http://sicurezzaonline.di.unimi.it/) bachelor's degree program.
They are probably simple and trivial programs but, you know, it's worth sharing!

## Exercises and examples

- hello-world-udp An UDP client that sends a simple "Hello World" datagram to a fixed address UDP Server.
- udp-server-node A fast up-and-running Node.JS UDP server that listens on 127.0.0.1.41234 and send back a message.
