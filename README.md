# Sockets 🔌
> A repository that stores various C exercises on network sockets

This repository contains various exercises and examples on network socket programming in C that I'm currently studyng for the "Networking" course of ["Sicurezza dei Sistemi e delle Reti Informatiche"](http://sicurezzaonline.di.unimi.it/) bachelor's degree program.
They are probably simple and trivial programs but, you know, it's worth sharing!

## Exercises and examples

- [hello-world-udp](./hello-world-udp): An UDP client that sends a simple "Hello World" datagram to a fixed address UDP Server.
- [tcp-server](./tcp-server): A basic iterative TCP server.
- [tcp-server-fork](./tcp-server-fork): A TCP server that spawns a child process for each incoming connection.
- [pizza](./pizza): A TCP pizza 🍕 delivery service.
- [popper](./popper): A simple dummy TCP POP3 client 📫 📧.
- [utils](./utils): A fast up-and-running Node.JS UDP server that listens on 127.0.0.1.41234 and send back a message.
